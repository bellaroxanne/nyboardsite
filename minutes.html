                <h4>Opening Statements</h4>
            </div>
                <p>Julia opened the fall meeting and welcomed the board members in attendance. A brief review of recent events ensued, with discussions on the screening of "Bis Gleich" and the Whitney Biennial Tour. Both were deemed very successful. A recent reading from the Book Club, "A Gentleman of Moscow" was highly recommended. Joan was thanked for hosting the fall cocktail party at the Cosmopolitan Club. Members were encouraged to friend-raise for the event.</p>
            <div id="report">
                <h4>Report from the School</h4>
            </div>
                <p>Randy's report from the school was read by Julia. The school is off to a solid start. E. Dixon gave $1 million for the Arts Center and another $1 million as a challenging gift with a November 15 deadline. Another million still needs to be raised to complete the project. Randy noted that he's been doing a lot of international travel this year, especially to Asia. He will be returning from Japan the day before the fall cocktail party and hopes to attend.</p>
                <p>There was a general discussion about possibly inviting educational consultants to some of our future events with the hope that they would be encouraged to promote the school. A St. Tim's in the City event was deemed an excellent opportunity for this.</p>

                <h4>Treasurer's Report</h4>
            </div>
                <p>Julia gave the report for Eleanor. Board members will receive a copy via email.</p>
            <div id="newBus">
                <h4>New Business</h4>
            </div>
                <p><strong>Tour of Glass House:</strong> A tour of Glass House in New Canaan, Connecticut is planned for the spring of 2018. It is to be led by the leading authority on Phillip Johnson and the curator of the museum, Dr. Hilary Lewis.</p>
                <p><strong>Brooklyn Navy Yard Tour:</strong> A tour of the new tech and creative industries that have reinvented the space at the Brooklyn Navy Yards is planned for early next year or into the spring. This would, by necessity, be a smaller group event. Heather is spearheading this and notes that they also have a rooftop vinyard and a distillery on the premisis.</p>
                <p><strong>Untermeyer Garden Tour:</strong> Urling reports that this event will need to be postponed for a year as the gardens are under an extensive renovation.</p>
                <p><strong>Collaberation with Winterim:</strong> We are working with the school to try to plan an activity with the Fives when they are here in February.</p>
                <p><strong>Winter Meeting:</strong> The winter meeting is slated for 5:30pm on January 23, 2018 at the Colony Club.</p>
                <p>Respctfully submitted, Elmer's Gluder, Recording Secretary</p>
